Sacrifice every card in the market. Tibus gains 5 Combat. <hr> Wild:
If you have any champions, Tibus stuns one. If not, discard two cards.
|
You take the first turn with a three-card starting hand. All normal rules apply.
Tibus starts with 40 Health and does not have a hand or personal deck. During Tibus' turn, reveal the top card of the Market Deck and place it face-up in front of Tibus. Tibus gains Combat equal to the cost of the revealed card. The faction of the revealed card determines Tibus' bonus ability for that turn (see reverse). If the revealed card has no faction, then you choose which bonus ability he uses for that turn. If Tibus has a card of each faction in front of him (Imperial,Guild,Necros,Wild), he gains an additional 15 Combat and sacrifices all his cards.
Tibus uses his Combat to stun your champions whenever possible, unless he can reduce your Health to zero. Tibus always attacks your champion with the highest defense that he can stun (you choose if there is a tie). After stunning all of the champions that he can, Tibus uses any remaining Combat to attack you directly, then his turn ends. Your guards protect you and your non-guard champions as normal.
Cards in front of Tibus don't do anything, except guards in front of him still protect him and his non-guard champions. During your turn, you may spend Combat to attack Tibus or the champion cards in front of him.
If you would make Tibus discard a card, instead choose one of his non-champion cards in play and sacrifice it.

|
On each player's first turn, they get a three-card starting hand. Play proceeds clockwise around the table.
Tibus starts with 40 Health per player in the game, and does not have a hand or personal deck. After each player's turn, Tibus takes a turn attacking that player. During Tibus' turn, reveal the top card of the Markel Deck and place it face-up in front of Tibus. Tibus gains Combat equal to the cost of the revealed card(s). The faction of the revealed card determines Tibus' bonus ability for that turn (see reverse). If the revealed card has no faction, then the defending player chooses which ability Tibus uses for that turn. If Tibus has a card of each faction (Imperial,Guild,Necros,Wild), then he gains an additional 15 Combat and sacrifices all of his cards.
Tibus uses his Combat to stun the defending player's champions whenever possible, unless he can reduce their Health to zero. Tibus always attacks the defending player's champion with the highest defense that he can stun (they choose if there is a tie). After stunning all of their champions that he can, Tibus uses any remaining Combat to attack that player. Guards protect the defending player and their non-guard champions as normal. Cards in front of Tibus don't do anything, except guards in front of him still protect him and his non-guard champions. During each player's turn, they may spend Combat to attack Tibus or the champion cards in front of him.
If a player would make Tibus discard a card, instead they choose one of his non-champion cards in play and sacrilice it.
